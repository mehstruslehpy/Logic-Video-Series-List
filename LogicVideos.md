## What is this list? 
A list of videos related to logic. There is no one theme besides being somewhat related to logic and appearing to be of decent quality. Each section heading is a channel name or author name. I have not watched them all.

## myweps2012:
Quite a few logic videos, including some fairly interesting logic videos covering various topics. Notably he discusses tableaux proofs, Gentzen styled deduction proofs, Axiomatic proof and more. Many videos are not sorted into playlists yet but courses are titled by ordering as in LO1 is the first video LO2 is the next video and so on. The video upload dates are fairly linear which helps with sorting.
